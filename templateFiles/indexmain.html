        <h1>Software Repository Reports</h1>
        <p>
            The reports are listed in approximate order of priority.
            Such as, bundles must not have missing legal files, and all
            bundles need to be signed (with few exceptions), and all
            bundles must use 4 part version numbers. The remaining
            reports are important, and ideally would be "clean", but
            normally would not prevent the release, or inclusion in the
            common repository. Except where noted, the checks are done
            directly are jars in the main common repository directories.
            That is, it does not check the "trusted repositories" we
            point to via composite indirection. See the <a
                href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Reports_FAQ">
                Reports FAQ</a> for more information about the code that
            generates the reports.

        </p>
        <p>Remember, these automated reports test a minimal view of
            the repository. For example, a bundle may have an about.html
            file, so is not listed in "missing files" report, but that
            does not mean the content of the about.html file is correct.
            In other words, Committers and Project Leads are still
            responsible for correctness -- these reports are more
            focused on obvious incorrectness, usually things that happen
            by small oversights, and which are often hard to "spot"
            until too late. Note too that many of the "errors" these
            reports list, can be caught at development time, in Eclipse
            IDE, by proper setting of PDE compiler settings.</p>
        <p>Also, remember, especially since these reports are "new"
            in this context, the reports may contain out-right errors
            and will certainly need improvement over time. Contributions
            welcome. Please open a bug in cross-project component if you
            see problems or have new contributions.</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>This report lists bundles and features that are
                missing important, required files. It looks directly at
                jars in the common repository. (Currently, does not
                check those "trusted repositories" we point to via
                composite indirection). Missing legal files are usually
                considered a "stop ship" issue, since Eclipse is well
                known for its IP quality.</dd>

            <dd>This report lists bundles and features that are
                that are not signed. Pretty serious issue, though there
                are a few exceptions. (well, only one code exception is
                known ... see below).</dd>

            </dt>
            <dd>To have p2 update correctly and OSGi to resolve
                bundles as expected, it is essential that bundles and
                features use the required 4 part versioning rules. Every

            </dt>
            <dd>Check to make sure features use the current,
                correct license. The report also lists features in
                repository with no license (SUA) in the content
                metadata. This report uses the repository's content
                metadata, instead of the jar files themselves, in
                contrast to the "missing files" report, above. Both are
                important to be correct, as different parts of Eclipse
                code use one or the other to present information to the
                user depending on the task.</dd>

            <dd>This report summarizes the 'required' element in the content.jar/xml file and lists

            where this results in overlap: some greedy, some not.

            <dd>Interesting report showing what BREEs are in use,
                and which bundles are missing it. All bundles with Java
                code should have one, but it is not required in

            <dd>Pack200 compression is important to save bandwidth.
                This report will never be perfect ... that is, there are
                cases where it is known that a jar can not be cleanly
                compressed with pack200. But nearly all can. So one or
                two from a project should be ignored as "OK" ... but a
                pattern of all jars/bundles from a project not being
                compressed indicates the project simply has not
                implemented that yet in their build or contribution
                process.</dd>

                names or incorrect localization settings. While we can
                not automatically know what the correct name of a bundle
                is, we can be sure it does not start with '%', and is
                not "Feature-Name" or "feature", etc. This test is ran

                or incorrect localization settings. While we can not

                we can be sure it does not start with '%', and is not

                (Bundle-Vendor directive) or incorrect localization
                settings. The best form of provider name is "Eclipse
                &lt;project name&gt;". Some projects have chosen a
                slightly different form, and can not automate every name
                check, but, again, we know it should not start with '%',
                not be "provider-name" nor be empty (null). This test is
                ran against the content metadata of the repository.</dd>

                for there to be multiple versions (e.g. when differ by
                major or minor versions), but sometimes looking at the
                multiple version report can spot unexpected cases where
                there are multiple versions. Even if so, it will usually
                not cause problems, but can at least be inefficient use
                of space (e.g. if differ only by qualifier).</dd>

                to spot typos and also find bundles or features in the
                repository that do not use 4 part versioning. (A report,
                above, also detects lack of 4 part versioning, but is
                based on jars, found in common directory, rather than
                all of content metadata in repository.)</dd>

                directive and the value of that directive. This
                directive (and report) is useful for some projects to
                help their community find their source code directly
                from their repository (to help make providing patches
                easier), but is not useful or appropriate for all
                projects. Use the directive, and the report, however
